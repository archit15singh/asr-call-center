 Thank you for calling on the Concierge Department. My name is Wendy with the and I'm able to in order to rent a car. I don't find the booking website really reliable at all. It's not really helping me get any cars. I understand where you're coming from. Sorry, but I'll be convenient being cars. We can go ahead and do a set. I could try to run the search in my end to see if I could get something there for you. Unfortunately, you cannot use your Bental Points anywhere else other than the website. Okay. We'll pretty sure something's wrong with the website because it's not giving me any results, but anywhere else I search. I'm really sorry. I'll need to go ahead and try to run the search on Mando. Okay. But I would need a phone number that's associated with the account. Can you provide that over to me, please? Okay. Does this seem that an account is being pulled up by that number? Do you think it's associated with an email address to provide me with, please? Yeah, it's okay. Okay. One moment. Okay. First, I was able to look at your account.

First, I'm new. Yeah. So unfortunately, I do see that it's giving me the same merit. Does it that everything is already sold out for these specific days that you are looking for? Yeah, but if you look at different time periods, it's going to say the same thing in a map in every location. Yeah. So I do see that being pulled up. I'm trying different dates and different locations. And I do see that everything is sold out as well. Yeah. I don't see anything being pulled up there. Or let me remind me of my machine, but I can find something in our back in the middle of your hotel. You have a closest location to any other area. One moment here.

This is what hurt. Oh, it says here. Which hurtful case? All right. Let me try to get. That is the only one that I see that is being picked up here. The only address that I have is that is the anything that I see here. Okay. If I search conquered myself, maybe I can find that. Look at it manually. Okay. I'm searching right now. It says we're unable to find any available vehicle in the conqueror. Did you put a specific date or cover something? Actually, like I said, this is in our back inventory.

So I have the economy shovel at Spark Poor PSR is similar. This is what hurts. I also have a compact car which is a Ford Focus, Nathan Bercer is similar. Why can't you go a little slower? Okay.

And then there is no other one to be picked up somewhere else. Unfortunately, sir. So I do have time left to pick it up. Okay. So all of them close at 12 PM. So I don't know what time you're seeing now, but. I'm in 10. My time is about 10.24. Okay. Because I have 11.24. So it doesn't give me a specific time as well. Time zone. But it is.

I'm not interested in an economy car. So you could avoid that, but I just want to make sure that you have a. Give me a list of cars that are between 80 to 120 dollars. And I can write for one day. All right. Start with the most expensive one. Okay. I love me a moment. So for the prices that I see here on my end, I do see that they were a bit. So I'm just trying to see more. Less the information that I could go ahead and give up. Okay. That's fine. If you could start from the most expensive one, you can start from the most expensive one. I'm not going to cut the bottom. Okay. Okay. So I have here a, one, a premium. Uh, brick, regal regal or similar. Uh, this is where you can. Can you go slower? I want to type it out brick regal or similar.

Just give us an easy, Chrysler 300 or similar. Okay. So what? I'm going to find out if I booked that one. Can you find out? Uh, for that, that would have to be directly with the agency. And I would have to give them a cause of fee. Okay. Can you find out if any of those locations are open to model? My offers and a roll of any, not out today. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's why you're going to be full. I try to see if I can get some information there. Okay. Good morning. Thank you for calling her. It's now remote. My name is Patti. How can I help you? Hi, Patti. This is one bee calling from. I could have a question about the car here. I wanted to know more or less about the luxury car. Uh, this one is for a, uh, allow me to get you that specific information there. This is the Chrysler 300 or similar. I just wanted to know more or less what year this is. Are you in a rental right now? Uh, no, but I'm actually trying to place a reservation for one of my clients, but he wants to know the exact year of this luxury Chrysler 300. Oh, okay. Let me check that for you. I'm in a event. What year is it? Chrysler 300. The Chrysler 300 is, we don't have one right now, but most of our cars are, are, uh, on you. We don't have a Chrysler 300 right now. Okay. So if I place this reservation for today, it wouldn't be available. No, it would not. We don't have a Chrysler 300. Okay. What? I need to close the $300. I'm going to have, excuse me. Go ahead. Sam? Healthy. I help you. Okay. I just wanted to know more or less what cars are available at the moment because he needs to pick this car up to date. And I see that you guys are closing at 12 PM. Yeah. So he needs a luxury car. He said he just wants to know more. He was interested in this one, but you said that they're not really available at the moment, so I don't want to go ahead and place that and that when he arrives, it's not there. So more or less what are the cars that you have available? I'm going to put you on a brief hold. Okay. Right now we are waiting on returns. We don't have anything available right at the moment. Would you like me to take your name in number and call you when something comes available? All right. So is it okay if I give you guys a call back? Because he said that he needs the car up to date. So more or less than about an hour. So I'll go ahead and send this information just to inform him that I don't see that there is anything available at the moment directly with you guys. And I'll see what I can fix with him. Okay. Then if you decide to make a video about it, thank you very much. How many people have you come in? All right. Bye bye. Hello? Thank you for holding. Okay. So I'm just glad in contact with the agency. And they explain that there are no cars available at the moment. And that is why we were seeing that there is nothing available in either for any dates on the website since it is, you know, close to California with the same agency. So they told me that there is nothing available and they're waiting on returns. So if we go ahead and book with her, that would not be possible there. So that is the only one that I'm seeing that is available at the moment here. For the specific location on the dates. Okay. Can I go ahead and book this with a price of $300? Okay. So like I said, if you go ahead and like I said, there is no car available and the luxury Chrysler isn't available as well as for what she just told me. So it wouldn't really be recommended to go ahead and place the reservation for today or either tomorrow because it would not be available now. Since they are just waiting on returns at the moment, they don't have any cars available. If you find out, you do some more search and you see there's any other locations besides the person that is close to me that has cars. Okay. I mean, one moment. Sarah, are you there? Yes. All right. Perfect. It seems that for the dates that you're looking for since it would be from today to tomorrow or either tomorrow or, you know, the 19th, it really does tell me that there is nothing available for the dates that you are looking for or these specific locations. I already tried and see all Concord and I don't see anything being pulled up there for the dates down. That you are requesting to have this car and everything that I tried says that they are already sold out. Okay. So you find out if there's any location close to me in Concord or any other city near me tomorrow? Sarah, okay. I'm trying everything in California and it doesn't seem that everything is giving me a location there. I've tried. Okay. What about one day? I've been changing the dates there and I don't see that there is nothing available. All of it tells me that they are sold out for any dates because I've tried from the 17 up to the 29th and I don't see any availability. Yeah, but when I look directly at the West Side or different call like the West Side, they say there is availability. But most likely the late year plus size. Like the fact that it's called the East and the West Side is called. Yeah. Like I said, I'm actually not specifically on the website. I'm in my back inventory and I still don't see that there is nothing available. Hello. Hello. The quality of the insurance and training purposes will all be disconnected in this call.
