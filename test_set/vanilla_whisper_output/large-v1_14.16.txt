I'm so sorry, I'm taking a long while for this, but I have to look into this. I'm holding on for a moment. I'm still just confirming something here. All right, no problem. Okay, thank you so much. Okay, I'm holding. Okay. Okay, so we already confirmed why the prices have been like this for a moment. Okay, so that is Los Cabos International Airport from the 21st at 1 p.m. to the 25th at 1 p.m. also. We have an intermediate car, a full-size car. We have a standard car, the compact, I'm just naming the type of car as the economy. There's also the premium car. There's economy sports utility vehicle, that's kind of big. And then there's a standard sports utility vehicle, that's the red one. Okay, let me ask you what kind of car I'm looking for. Maybe it would be, is there, is there any way? Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Yes, is there any way if we can check for a Jeep Wrangler or Jeep Sahara? A Jeep? Yes. Okay, let me see if we have any Jeeps available. When I checked the website, there was some, I'm not sure. No, we don't have any Jeeps available at the moment. Okay. Yeah. Okay, so is there any other mid-size SUVs I could do a wrap for? Okay, let me see. Well, there is this economy SUV. Okay, which is, how much? There's the Jeep range, and that is $77 a day. Alright, anything cheaper? Yes, we do have cheaper. Then there's the, there's the, one moment. The rental copter, that is $14 a day, which gives you a total of $56. What car is that? That is, it's an economy SUV also. But that's the budget, and it's $14 a day, which gives you a total of $56. I want you to know that this price does not include taxes made by the car rental. How much are the taxes, do you know, or am I going to find out over there? Well, I could, they do have additional taxes, such as, I could name you some of them, but we don't have all of them that is really with the car rental. But do you know how much, what the average? No, but what I can do is I can call the car rental and I can check for all things they have, if that's okay with you. Okay, so what kind of car is this again? This is an economy, budget-intensive vehicle. Okay, but what brand of car is it? Let me get it here. It's a renewal copter. A what? A renewal copter. I can't understand what that is. Can you hear me? What's the brand of it? Is it Chrysler? Um, no. Okay, let me throw that out, because maybe you're not understanding me. It's R-E-N-A-U-L-T, then another word, C-A-P-T-U-R. What was the second one? C-A-P-T-U-R, copter. Oh, it's a renewal, okay. Yeah. All right. So, what I can do is I could call the car company and I could ask them what all fees they do include in that. Okay. When you pick it up, is that okay? Okay. Well, is this your best contact number? Yes. Are you going to call me back or do I just hold? I'm going to call you back, because at the moment my dollar is having a little technical difficulty, so I will give you a call back. Okay. Why don't I go ahead and book something, and then once you find out, then I can just, um... I could tell you. Yeah, that's okay. Are you on the website also? Uh, hold on. I can get on the website in two seconds. Just give me one minute. Okay, I'm on the website already. Okay, well, you can do your bookings, and I'm going to call the car company. Um, will you be booking the same car? Well, I don't know. There's, like, too many options here. I don't know which one I'm going to book. That's why I want to try to do the bookings. Yeah, because I will need to know, um, what car company to contact, because there is Alamo, Enterprise, Budget, Dollar, Trifty, and I will need to know which, um, car company I will need to contact. Oh, oh, I see. Let me just do... So which one am I booking here? Economy car, compact full-size car, or just the mini car, premium car? Whatever one you want, then. Just select it. It will start off with the cheapest one, which is Budget, or whatever. Which one is the cheapest, it will start off. Okay, I'm looking here right now. It's a Ford... Hold on. Yeah, it's Ford, economy Ford utility vehicle for $12 a day. Yeah, economy Ford utility vehicle. Let me see if I find that. It's the same car. It's a Renault pickup truck. Hmm, okay. Yes, uh-huh. And it's going into next-down? It's from Budget? Yes, it's from Budget. Oh, so you have to run your search again? Mm-hmm. Oh, I have to do a search to run it. Yes, so since it's from Budget, what I could do is I could call them. Okay, so which one do I... Which one do I choose here? Mauricio Plaza, or do I go Pucateteras, whatever? Is that on the location section? Yeah, the location. It gives you two options for the location, but it doesn't give you the airport. So which one is the airport? Okay, you type in SJD. That is the airport phone. Uh, do I fill the pickup location? I put in the number of the airport? Mm-hmm. SJD. And then it will provide you with that airport. SJD. Mm-hmm. Or Scarborough International Airport? Then you fill in your date? Yeah, put the date and... The time? Date are there. Then you run the search again. Okay. Oh, there you go. Thank you. Okay. And I want to go down. It will give you that. Oh, okay. So you're just already giving me that. Mm-hmm. And that's the budget. Yeah, it says 41, 57. So this would be budget at the airport, right? Mm-hmm. Okay, perfect. So I really don't need to do anything else, right? No. You just... Will you be booking it on your end, or do you want me to book it on my end? No, no, I'm able to book it here. Okay. I think I'm able to book it here. Do you still want me to call you? No, it's fine. No, no, don't worry about it. Okay, well, is there anything else you would like me to assist you with today?
