 Thank you for calling on the COS department. My name is Wendy with whom we have the pleasure of speaking with today. Hi Jason, how are you doing today? Oh, that's so good. I found out that I'm not able to find any locate that are offering a rental car to throw in my $100 bank balance and I have with Pennzoil. I keep searching every single town with us. There's no results. So I think something's wrong here. I want to know if it's possible. I could use my Pennzoil savings code somewhere else in order to rent the car. I don't find the booking website really reliable at all. It's not really helping me get any cars. Okay, I understand where you're coming from. Really sorry, Brian. The convenience being caused. What I can go ahead and do is that I can try to run the search in my end to see if I could get something there for you. Unfortunately, you cannot use your rental points anywhere else other than the website. Okay, well, I'm pretty sure something's wrong with the website because it's not giving me any results. But no matter where I search. I'm really sorry. Allow me to go ahead and try to run the search on MANDO. Okay, but I would need a phone number that's associated with the account. Can you provide that over to me, please? Okay, doesn't seem that an account is being pulled up by that number. Do you think it's associated with an email address or you provide me with please? Okay, one moment. Okay, first, I was able to look at your account. Thank you for being a member of Pencils Travel Rewards. Allow me one moment. Let me go ahead and try to run the search. Could you provide me the information for this car until where will it be picked up and where will it be dropped off? The series auto-series auto-center in Antioh find out what options are available. I want to find out car. That's a four-car that I could rent for around 90 to $120 for one day. For one day. What will be this specific day today? Today. Today. Early as possible parts today. In Antioh, correct? That's Antioh, California. Yes. And when will the car be dropped off tomorrow, the 18th, correct? Yes. Will you be picking up at noon? Who is fine? And dropping off at the same time. Yeah, so it's unfortunately, I do see that it's giving me the same error. It does says that everything is already sold out for these specific days that you are looking for. Yeah, but if you look at different time periods, it's going to say the same thing in every location. Yeah, so I do see that being pulled up and trying different dates and different locations and I do see that everything is sold out as well. Yeah, I don't see anything being pulled up there. Allow me one moment. Let me see if I can find something in our back inventory for you. Okay. You have the closest location to Antioh. One moment here. I'm just trying to see if I can find something there. Okay. All right. Okay. So I'm seeing here that for the date that you are looking for, I have a economy, shovel it spark, Ford PSR is similar. This is what hurts. It says here. What's her location? All right. Let me try to get that is the only one that I see that is being picked up here. The only address that I have is that is the only thing that I see here. Okay. If I search Concord myself, maybe I could find that and look at it manually. Okay. I'm searching right now and it says we're unable to find any available vehicles in Concord. Did you put a specific date or time or something? Actually, like I said, this is in our back inventory. So it's something that only the agents have access to. So this is something that we see. Yeah. So basically. You give me the list of the options. Okay. So I have the economy, shovel it spark, Ford PSR is similar. This is what hurts. I also have a compact car, which is a Ford Focus Nissan Versa similar. This is what you could go. Can you go a little slower? Okay. Sorry about that. That is the compact Ford Focus Nissan Versa or similar. This is to be about two, four, as well. It says 12.92 miles from Antion City Center. I also have an economy shovel it spark Ford Focus similar again. To be picked up. That location said it's closed. Can you look at the hurts and monuments Boulevard? Okay. Okay. Not a problem. So it says here, closes at 12 PM as well. So that will be the time that you will be picking up the car. Okay. So which location? It seems that all of them close at 12 PM and then there is no other one to be picked up somewhere else. Unfortunately, sir. So I do have time left to pick it up. Okay. So all of them close at 12 PM. So I don't know what time you're seeing now, but at my time. I'm in 10. My time. My time. My time is 10.24 a.m. Okay. Cause I have 11.24. So it doesn't give me a specific time as well. Time zone. But it is. So it does says here at 12 PM. 9 a.m. to 12 PM. California. So I'm still open. The same location you're talking about. Yes. So that will be. Crow Canyon. It says here. Wait a minute. I thought you said none of the concrete locations are open right now. No, sir. Unfortunately, not all of them are closed. And the only ones in San Ramon. Okay. That's fine. Let me see what. So tell me the options available in that location. Okay. So for that one, I have an economy, shovel, it's part board, PSR are similar. That is the only one. And then I have a compact car, which is also at the Crow. Crow Canyon for a Ford Focus. Nice and very similar as well. I'm looking for something around 100 or 100 between 90 and $120. And family mode. Is that the only location where you're able to find anything near me? Yeah. So like I said, everything else is already closed. The only one that will close as well is the one in Crow Canyon place. Okay. So I have about 30 minutes to make. I have about an hour over an hour until I can make it over there. So yes, can we give me the list of cars that have a six cylinder, eight cylinder? I'm looking, I'm only interested. I'm not interested in an economy car. So you could avoid that, but I just want to make sure that you have a six. Give me a list of cars that are between 80 to $120. And I can rent for one day. And I started with the most expensive one. Okay. Allow me one moment. So for the prices that I see here on my end, I do see that they're a bit cheap. So I'm just trying to see more or less the information that I could go ahead and give out to you. Okay. That's fine. I mean, if you can start from the most expensive one, talk to bottom. Okay. So I have here a one, a premium, a brick, regal, regal, or similar. This is 20. Can you go slower? I want to type it out. Brick, regal, or similar? What type of brick regal is it? It's just this premium brick regal or similar. That is the car type there. It doesn't really. I mean, I know what's modeled. Okay. Oh, I see. So I see what you need. Is it a 2017 regal turbo premium? Yeah. Okay. And how much is that for? Okay. So this one is for $97 total. Okay. I'm not interested in that one. Can you go on to the next one? Okay. Okay. I have a luxury chrysler 300 or similar. And how much is that? This is for 80 total. What year? Okay. This one does not specify which year it is. Exactly. It just gives me the chrysler 300 or similar. Okay. So what would you find out if I booked that one? Can you find out? For that, that would have to be directly with the agency. And I would have to give them a call to see. Okay. Can you find out if any of those locations are open tomorrow, tomorrow, conference, and all of them, or any of them? Not. I'll just put it today. Okay. Okay. Is it okay if I place you in a brief school while I try to see if I can get some information there? Okay. Good morning. Thank you for calling her. My name is Patti. How can I help you? Hi Patti. This is Wendy calling from... I just have a question about a car here. I wanted to know more or less about the luxury car. This one is for a... allow me to get you that specific information there. This is the chrysler 300 or similar. I just wanted to know more or less what year this is. Are you in a rental right now? No, but I'm actually trying to place a reservation for one of my clients, but he wants to know the exact year of this luxury chrysler 300. Oh, okay. Let me check that for you. I'm going to... What year is it, Chrysis 300? The Chrysis 300 is... We don't have one right now, but most of our cars are new. We don't have a Chrysis 300 right now. Okay. So if I placed this reservation for today, it wouldn't be available. No. It would not. We don't have a Chrysis 300. Okay. What I need... Chrysis 300. I'm going to... Excuse me. Nam. Help you. I help you. Okay. I just wanted to know more or less what cars are available at the moment, because he needs to pick this car up today. And I see that you guys are closing at 12 p.m. Yes. So he needs a luxury car? He said he just wants to know more... He was interested in this one, but you said that they're not really available at the moment, so I don't want to go ahead and place that on that when he arrives. It's not there. So more or less, what are the cars that you have available? I'm going to put you on a brief hold. Okay. Right now we are waiting on returns. We don't have anything available right at the moment. Would you like me to take your name and number and call you when something comes available? All right. So is it okay if I give you guys a call back, because he said that he needs the car today, so more or less than about an hour. So I'll go ahead and send this information just to inform him that I don't see that there's anything available at the moment directly with you guys, and I'll see what I can fix with him, okay? Then if he decides that I can give you guys a call back. Thank you very much. I'm going to take you a comment. All right. Bye-bye. Hello. Thank you for holding. Okay. So I just got in contact with the agency and they explained that there are no cars available at the moment, and that is why we were seeing that there is nothing available, neither for any dates on the website, since it is, you know, close to California with the same agency. So they told me that there is nothing available and they're waiting on returns. So if we go ahead and book with Hertz, that would not be possible there. Since that is the only one that I'm seeing that is available at the moment here for the specific location and the dates. Okay. Can I go ahead and book this for the price of $100? Okay. So like I said, if you go ahead and like I said, there is no car available and the luxury chrysler isn't available as well as for what she just told me. So it wouldn't really be recommended to go ahead and place the reservation for today or either tomorrow because it would not be available now. Since they are just waiting on returns at the moment, they don't have any cars available. Why, Val, can you find out? Can you do some more search and receive there than the other locations besides the cars that are posted on the website? Okay. I'll tell me one moment there. Sarah, are you there? All right. Perfect. It seems that for the dates that you're looking for, since it would be from today to tomorrow or either tomorrow or, you know, the 19th, it really does tell me that there is nothing available for the dates that you are looking for or these specific locations. I already tried anti-concored and I don't see anything being pulled up there for the dates that you are requesting to have this car. And everything that I tried says that they are already sold out. Okay. So you find out if there's any locations close to me in conquer or any other city near me tomorrow? Sure. Okay. I'm trying everything in California and it doesn't seem that everything is giving me a location there. I've tried. Okay. What about Monday? I've been changing the dates, Sarah, and I don't see that there is nothing available. All of it tells me that there are sold out for any dates because I've tried from the 17 up to the 29th and I don't see any availability. Yeah, but when I look directly at the website for a different collection website, they say there is availability. But it's most likely related to your website. Like the thumb is the news and the website itself. Yeah, well, like I said, I'm actually not specifically on the website. I'm in my back inventory and I still don't see that there is nothing available. Hello. Hello. The quality assurance and training purposes. I'll be disconnecting this call.
