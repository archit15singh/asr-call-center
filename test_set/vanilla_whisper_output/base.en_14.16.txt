Okay, so we already confirmed the why the prices have been like this at the moment. Okay, so that is Los Cabos International Airport from the 21st at 1 p.m. to the 25th at 1 p.m. Also, we have an intermediate car, a full-size car. We have a standard car, the compact. I'm just naming the recycle car as an economy. There's also the premium car. There's economy sports utility vehicle. That's kind of big. And then there's a standard sports utility vehicle. That's a red one. Okay, let me ask you what kind of car I'm looking for. Is there? Is there any way? Can you hear me? Yes, I could hear you. Yes, is there any way if we can check for a Jeep Wrangler or Jeep Sahara? Yes. Okay, let me see if we have any Jeep available. When I check the website, they're awesome. I'm not sure. I don't know. We don't have any Jeep available at the moment. Okay. Yes. Okay, so is there any other mid-size car? Well, there is this economy SUV. Okay, which is how much? There's the Jeep range, and that is $77 a day. Anything cheaper? Yes, we do have cheaper. Then there's the one moment. The rental capture, that is $14 a day, which gives you a total of $56. What car is that? That is an economy SUV also. That's a budget, and it's $14 a day, which gives you a total of $56. I want you to know that this price does not include taxes made by the car rental. How much are the taxes? I'm not going to find out a little bit. Well, they do have additional taxes, such as economy, some of them, but we don't have all of them that is doing with the car rental. But you know how much the other is? No, but what I can do is I can call the car rental and I can check for all things they have. Is that okay with you? Okay, so what kind of car is this again? This is the economy's budget utility vehicle. Okay, but what brand is it? Let me get it here. Is it a renewal capture? Or what? A renewal capture. Okay, it's not a dream. What's the benefit? It's a crisis? No. Okay, let me fill it up because maybe you're not understanding me. It's a REN, A-U-L-C. Then another word, C-A-P-U-R. What is it like? C-A-P-T-U-R capture. Oh, it's a renewal. Yeah. All right. So what I can do is I could call the car company and I could ask them what all fees they do include in that. Okay. When you pick it up, is that okay? Sure. Okay. Well, is this your best contact number? Yes, are you going to call me back or do I just call this? I'm going to call you back because at the moment, my dollars is having a little technical difficulty, so I will give you a call back. Okay, why don't I go ahead and book something and then watch the find out that I can just, uh... I could tell you, yeah, that's okay. Are you on the website also? Uh, hold on. I can get on the website. I can get on the website. I'll give you one minute. Okay, how on the website are you? Okay. Well, you could do your bookings and I'm going to call the car company. Um, you will be booking the same car? Well, I don't know. There's too many options here. I don't know which one I'm going to book. That's how I want to start to do it with you. Yeah, because I will need to know, um, what car company to come back because there is all of them all enterprise, budget, dollar, trustee, and I will need to know which car company I will need to contact. Oh, oh, I could say let me just do... So which car am I booking here? Economy car, contact full-size car, or let's say, mini-car, premium car. Mm-hmm. Whatever you want, then just select it. It will start off with the fee-passed-long, which is budget, or whatever, which one is the fee-passed, it will start off. Okay, I'm looking here right now. It's the port. Hold on. Yeah, it's the port. Economy is the port you still need to wait for. Yeah. It's the port. It's the cost of the day. Economy is the reason to leave me. Let me see if I find that. It's the same car, it's the Renault TIG factory. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yes, uh-huh. And it's going to connect that? Yes, it's from budget. Yes, it's from budget. Oh, because you have to run your search again. Mm-hmm. Oh, I'm glad to do the search again. Yes, so I'm thinking it's from budget, what I could do is I could call them. Okay, so which one do I choose here? Maricio Plaza, or do I go to Calasera, or whatever? Is that on the location section? Yeah, the location is just the two options for the station, but it doesn't do the airport, so which one is the airport? Okay, you type in SJB, now that is the airport phone? Uh, so the application I put, I'm going to call them. Mm-hmm. SJB. And then it will provide you with that airport. Very deep. Mm-hmm. It's probably just a mess or anything. Then you fill in your date? Yeah, for the date and... Your time? Yeah, it's out there. Then you run the search again. Okay. Oh, there you go. Thank you. Okay. And then once you pull down, it will give you that. Oh, okay, so I just got to give you that. Mm-hmm. And that's your budget. Yeah, it takes 41, 50 seconds, so this would be budget at that airport, right? Mm-hmm. Okay, perfect. I really don't need to do anything else, right? No. You just, are you, will you be bookaded on your end or do you want me to book it on my end? No, no, no, no, I'm able to book it here. Okay, so... So, do you still want me to call now?
