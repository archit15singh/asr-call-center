Okay. Okay, so we already confirmed the wide surprises have been like this. One moment. Okay, so that is the most troublesome the national airport from the 21st at one BM to the 25th at one BM also. Um, we have an intermediate car, a full-size car. We have a standard car, the compact. I'm just naming the cyberpar as the economy. There's also the premium car. There's economy sports utility vehicle that's kind of big. And then there's the standard sports utility vehicle that's a red one. Okay, let me ask you what kind of car I'm looking for. Let me see. Is that anyway? Can you hear me? Yes, I could hear you. Yes, is there any way if you can check for a Jeep Wrangler or Jeep Cara? Yes. Okay. Let me see if we have any Jeep's available. All right, check the website. They're awesome. Um, no, we don't have any Jeep available at the moment. Okay. Yes. Um, Okay, so is there any other mid-time between track and server that I've bought? Okay, let me see. Well, there is this economy SUV. Okay, which is, uh, how much? Um, there's the Jeep range and that is $77 a day. All right, anything cheaper? Yes, we do have cheaper. Then there's the, um, there's the one moment, the rental capture. That is $14 a day, which gives you a $56. Look right there. That is, uh, it's an economy SUV also. But that's a budget and it's $14 a day, which gives you a $56. I want you to know that this price does not include taxes made by the, um, car rental. Yeah, how much are the taxes? You know, or am I going to find out over there? Well, I think they do have additional taxes such as I can name you some of them, but we don't have all of them that literally with the car rental. But what I could believe in that, how much, what's the out of it? No. No, but what I could do is I could call the car and don't have a trip for all things they have. Is that okay with you? Okay, so what kind of cars this again? This is a economy's for utility vehicle. Okay, no one. What brand of the car is it? Uh, let me get it here. It's a renewal capture. Hey, what?

Then another word C, A, P, T, U, R. Uh, I wore the record one. C, A, P, T, U, R, capture. Oh, it's your winner, I'll say. Yeah. All right. So, um, what I could do is I could call the um, car opinion. I could ask them what all fees they do include in that. Okay. When you pick it up, is that okay? Sure. Okay. Well, is this your best contact number? Yeah. Are you going to call me back or do I just call? Um, I'm going to call you back because at the moment, my dollars is having a little technical difficulties. So I will give you a call back. Okay.
