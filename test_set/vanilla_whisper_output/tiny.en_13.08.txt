 Marty? Hello. The reservation department. Yes. Hello. Can you hear me? I'm here. Yes. I hear you. Hi. I'm playing regarding reservation to one nine of the three. Yeah. Yeah. Hope to in right. Hold on. Hold on with that before you. Yeah. Hi. Okay. I'll start going. I'm going to start. No problem before we proceed. I just want to inform you that the college being recorded for quality assurance and training purposes. Sure. Okay. I understand. Marking that you are looking for assistance with confirming a reservation. No, we're not we're not looking for that anymore because I make very clear that when we have a reservation. We've realized that we got to we got to the reservation that almost over two hours ago. And I got there and they said that we didn't have the reservation in my name. And I from what we were supposed to get there last night and didn't have it last night. And you didn't say just the right reservation number for $1. And maybe they needed it somewhere else. And I said, well, no, they shouldn't have said clearly on my reservation for $1. And so because she contacted you guys and she was on chat with somebody and I kept that to somebody and I was in somebody. But when I called her when I called her number, I kept getting direction to a number. So I would say, flip the right thing code in and when I did it hung up on it. And that happened to her. You have to be three times in her house. So I was never able to get to me first and then talk to you. And so what I did was I just said to heck with this and I just went to the car for me directly. So I wanted, I wanted, I would like to get a read box because it was, it was handled in properly by you guys. And most important, most of that is I'm supposed to be telling you promoting your future. I'm not, I'm not just a customer. I'm a distributor, I'm a consultant. So the fact that I'm having a, now I've had multiple good experience using guys ready. Not that I was quick, but if I had one of my customers go through the experience I just went through, it was the worst thing that was the ability to be. So the, for me, it's what's going to happen to me. I can live with it with I think it's $1. But the idea that somebody will come to a rental counter, expect to have the car, have it all there and realize that you didn't even have the right reservation number. It's the, the, the, you guys, and then, and then, and then, I couldn't even get through a customer first. That's just totally wrong. Yeah, and I understand that really a problem with drive-threading convenience is here, that cause to you. Mark, I just wanted a quick question. You went to pick up your vehicle today and not yesterday. We did because we are, our flight was canceled. And we got, we got, we got to, we got our connects flight and Detroit. And they, the flight, because of weather delays, playing got there at 130 in the morning. And the pilot couldn't fly anymore, so they went to get another crew that they couldn't, so they, they couldn't get a crew, so just 30 this morning. So they could have stepped on a hotel, we'd have to, just 30. And so we got, we got here last thing, just in that night. But the, the, the car, the car, the rental company to inform them of this. But at your reservation is on Mark, that's a no-trow. We wanted to market a no-show. It wasn't Mark, it was a reservation there at all. No, I mean, if you got there possibly, it was Mark, there's no show and they don't have the reservation on file. That's why I'm asking, did you call them to inform, okay, you know, I'm going to be able to pick it up until today, because you know our flight got delayed, so that they don't market as no show and your reservation is not canceled. I did. Who did you speak to? I don't know who I spoke to. I didn't get a name. You were, yes, I understand. We were in Detroit, Michigan. We were in an airport. We were waiting, we were waiting to find out. We didn't find out that we weren't going to make it until 1 30 in the morning. So it was already, it was already almost tomorrow there. It was almost midnight. And here in Las Vegas, I was finding that happen. So there was no, it was just a call and I, it's held and we learned common. I didn't ask who I was talking to, I didn't make it matter. And did they tell you that everything was okay? Did, they didn't even, I didn't please, they asked you for reservation number. I told you the reservation number and they said, great, we'll put it on the record. To give them our reservation number and not the one on the confirmation letter. The only, there was only one reservation number, 932, wherever it was 637. I only had one number on the letter and the confirmation. On the confirmation letter, there is a vendor reference number, that's the number that you use to provide it to the rental company, which is 751492522. That's how they normally locate your reservation. Read that, ask the call that is marked in a victim order. We're talking at the end to the third, the reason. Their vendor number, it starts to go into letter 8 or the local letter 8. That number you gave, you gave me, told me that that is not there, that they don't have any system number. The reason I'm asking all this is because what happens is that if you're not a first to go ahead and request a refund, we need to have all the possibilities that were taken, everything so that we can know whether the car rental company will approve a refund or not. What I'm going to go ahead and do is I'm going to go ahead and submit the request. Do you have the receipt for the new reservation that you booked? Yes. Can you send it over to me please? I'm going to give you an email. Yes. Okay. Send it to a reservation. Hold on, hold on, hold on. You want to need the right to send? Yes, sir, because you need to send the receipt to that email. Hold on. Can we get a pen? Sure. Okay. Good. So, reservation, plural. Is it okay? Act? Yes. Vacation owners? Yes. Dot. Yes. Dot. Yes. Okay. Okay. And then you can go ahead and send it over to me please. Can you send it right now? I also want to, I left the agreement in the car which we would be right as soon as we are either. But hold on. Let me give you a support schedule. I'm not having a good discussion. Oh, here is hold on. Sure. Yeah, no, I left in the car. I said, I'll ask you to get it. We'll go. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Yep. I did. I left in the car. So, I'll go down and get it all. You know, I think it's your name. It's Blanca. Blanca. Okay. So, let me just go ahead and please you're in a brief hold. I will reach out to the rental company and I'll write that with you. Okay. Before you do the BLA and CA or BLA and CA. CA. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, just go with me one moment on the line, Martin. And I'll be right back with you. Thank you. Okay. Yep. Thank you for holding, Martin. I do apologize for the delay. I'm still trying to get through with this rental company. Okay. I'm sorry for the delay. There with me one more moment more, please. Sure. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for holding. I do apologize for long delay. I'm here, Blanca. Okay. Okay. And did you manage to get your receipt? Okay. If I went to get it, I would have lost you in the elevator. So, you know, I have to go there and get it. Okay. No problem then. So, go ahead and send it over to me. I spoke to $1. And yes indeed, they weren't able to find the reservation. So, apparently it seems as if this was not confirmed at $1. So, what we need to do is we need to work on our request for this. But in order for me to submit the refund request, we need to go ahead and have a used to have the receipt for the new rental that was made. Okay. And that way we can go ahead and run this request. Well, here's a question of why that doesn't seem necessary. Let me just offer you a seat. Okay. So, what my wife wanted to do is just take a new road. We don't need a rental car. So, what if we just said we'll take an Uber and we're not going to get a rental car all? You wouldn't need the receipt for that. Next case, right? Yes, we would bank statements. Yes, we'd reflect the charge for the Uber. Okay. Okay. All right, fair enough. So, you asked for my question. Thank you for that. All right. Yes, you would have happened. Okay, yes, you would have happened to Martin if that's sorry about that. No, I don't think that's going to be what happens. What happens is that you have to, you know, we are a third party company, right? So, we go through suppliers. So, in order for us to request something from the suppliers, they will always trust me. They will always ask for backup. Sure. You know, for us to give them backup. For them to, you know, be able to work with ever request we are asking for. That's why I'm asking you for a receipt soda in the longer run. If I submit the request afterwards, you know, they're not going to ask me for that again. You know, and I will be to give them that because you know, I don't have it. So, that's why I'm asking you to send it over. Yep. You know, as soon as possible, that way the better, the quicker we get it, the better because we can start working on this. Yes. And really, to pass it, I'll be able to get the food. So, we're both, we agree on it. So, here's the question. Which part of the agreements you need is multiple pages? The one where you just made the reservation basically and how much you paid. Okay. Yes, fair enough. Okay. Good. Okay. Great. I will. Thank you, Block. I appreciate your help very much. And no problem about that, Mark, in the request will be submitted. Okay. At the moment, I cannot go ahead and guarantee you anything because, you know, we still have to go through the supplier. But the request is there. So, I mean, we definitely will go ahead and work on it. And as soon as we get an update, you will be notified. Okay, Mark, can you? Yes. So, here's a, that's exactly what we've got to do. We always agree on this. No. You guys need to work on your portal because, when I, like I said, if I was in front of your customer agency, that was people online, waiting for that. And I couldn't get through to you at all because I followed your path through the number of, you know, through the trade. And what it said, if you want to talk to somebody right in the registration, press pick. Well, when I press two, it hung up on me. What time was it? No, it wasn't just one. It happened to me twice. It happened to her once. So, it was the same thing. At what time, do you know? I can tell you what's true. It happened in 915. It happened in 913. You have an accord to ten. Sorry, what time was that? Well, you need these exact nine. It happened. It happened every time I did it. So, we were two online. We first got there. It was around 40-10. It happened to 45-25. And then, at the clock, it happened to her. She happened to her first. And it happened to me twice. So, I can't give it to that time. I can't give it to that time. I can't give it to that time. I can't give it to that time. So, I can't give it to that time. But, that was around those times. If I did it right now, I can guarantee the same thing would happen. I will report a page. Yeah. So, I'm asking because I could have possibly been when our office was still closed, but I mean, if it was during that time, it was like 11-hour time and we are available from 9am Eastern Standard Time. This is what we've done. This has been the time that you were open. So, you're easy to come. There's no question. You have to. That wouldn't have been the issue, but. Exactly. Exactly. Because we open at 9am Eastern Standard Time. So, I mean, if you call 10 Pacific, yeah, we would definitely should have answered. I'm not sure what happened there. Yeah. And again, I'm going to ask, I'm giving you this as a customer service group because I'm not just a customer. I'm a consultant. I'm expecting to give other people the go ahead to use your service. And I would hate to get anybody that I'd like to have to go through what I want you today. Yeah. Yeah, I couldn't imagine. Right. Yeah. I understand they're a marketing and I apologize. Yep. Hello. Yep. Hello.
