I hear you Hi I'm regarding preservation to one nine three Yeah, I hope to hope ten right hold hold on one second before you yeah, I see okay Yeah, I'll sorry go in No problem before we proceed. I just want to inform you that the college being recorded for quality assurance and training purposes Okay, I understand Martin that you are looking for assistance with confirming a reservation No, we're not we're not looking for that anymore because I made very clear that when we We realize that we got to we got to the reservation that Almost over two hours ago and I got there and they said that we didn't have the reservation of my name And I said well we were supposed to get there last night and they didn't have it last night I'm either and he said just couldn't the right reservation number for $2 and maybe they need to visit somewhere else and I said well no They said clearly on my reservation for dollar and Because she contacted you guys and she was on chat with somebody I got that to somebody and I wasn't that with somebody when I called them when I called your number I kept getting directed to a number that would say Put the right thing coded when I did it hung up on me and that happened to her You have to be three times in a row So I was never able to get to be a person at talk to and so what I did was I just said the heck with this And I and I just went to the car from the directly So that so I want I want I would like to get a refund because It was it was handled improperly by you guys and Most of boy the most that is I'm supposed to be selling and promoting I'm not I'm not just a customer. I'm a distributor. I'm a consultant. So the fact that I'm having you know Multiple good experience Not that I was quit but but if I had one of my customers go to the experience I just went through It was the worst embarrassing it would be you know the So for me it was to happen to me. I can live with it was thank you for dollars But but the idea that somebody would come to a rental counter expect to have the car have it all there They realize that you didn't even have the right reservation number That didn't you guys and then and then I couldn't even get through a customer first person. That's that's just totally wrong Yeah, and I understand I really apologize for the inconveniences here that caused to you um Martin just one quick question you went to pick up your vehicle today and not yesterday We did because we are our flight was canceled and we got we got to reveal we got our connection flight in Detroit And they the flight because of whether the ladies playing got there at 1 30 in the morning Pilot couldn't fly anymore. So they went to get another crew that they couldn't so they they couldn't get a crew until 30 this morning So they put us up in a hotel We got to 30 and so we got to we got here Las Vegas is at nine Control company to inform them office But at your reservation is not marked as a no show We wasn't marked as a no show wasn't marked it was a reservation in there at all No, I mean if you've got there possibly it was marked as no show and they don't have the reservation on file That's why I'm asking did you call them to inform? Okay, you know I'm gonna be able to pick it up until today because you know our flight got delayed so that they don't mark it as no show and your reservation is not canceled I Did who did you speak to I don't know what to I didn't get named you were yes understand We were in Detroit Michigan we were in airport. We were waiting you're waiting to find that we didn't find out that we weren't going to make it So one 30 in the morning. So it was already it was already almost tomorrow there It was all it was almost midnight and here in Las Vegas So there was no it was just a call and I tell them we weren't coming I didn't ask who I was talking to I didn't make it matter and did they tell you that everything was okay? He didn't even I didn't believe the answer for reservation number I told them the reservation number and they said great will put on the record You gave them our reservation number and not the one on the confirmation letter the only it was only one reservation number 932 wherever was 637 we don't I only had one number on the letter and a confirmation on the confirmation letter There is a vendor reference number. That's the number that you use to provide it to the rental company Which is 751 4925 to to that's how they normally locate your reservation Their vendor number is not The letter H or the letter H that number you gave me that you gave me Told me that that is not there that they don't have any such number Yeah, the reason I'm asking all this is because what happens is that in order for us to go ahead and request a refund We need to have all the possibilities that were taken You know everything so that we can know whether the car rental company will approve a refund or not What I'm gonna go ahead and do is I'm gonna go ahead and submit the request. Do you have the receipt? For the new reservation that you booked. Yes. Can you send it over to me, please? I'm gonna give you an email Yes Okay, send it to reservation Hold on hold on. Hold on. I have to write you I need to write this in Yes, sir, because you need to send it to receive to that email. Hey, hold on. We get me to pen Sure, okay Reservations plural Okay act Yes vacation owners Yes Okay, and then you can go ahead and send it over to me. Please let me know can you send it right now? Also, I left the agreement in the car which was the brightest in all these are but hold on Sure Yeah, no, I left a left in the car Get it that way all that I did I left in the car so I'll go down and get it all it only take a few minutes wait, man I didn't catch your name. It's Blanca Blanca, okay So let me just go ahead and place you in a brief hold I will reach out to the rental company and now write that with you. Okay, so before you do the BLA and CA or BLA and CA Okay And I'll be right back with you. Thank you. Okay Thank you for holding Martin I do apologize for the delay. I'm still trying to get through with this rental company Okay, I'm sorry for the later with me want more moment more please Thank you so much. Thank you so much for holding I do apologize along the way I'm here blockers Did you manage to get your receipt? Okay, if I went to get it, I would have lost you in the elevator. So no I have to go there and get it. Oh Okay, no problem then so go ahead and send it over to me I spoke to dollar and yes indeed they weren't able to find the reservation He's apparently it seems as if this was not confirmed at dollar So what we need to do is we need to work on our request for this But in order for me to submit the refund request we need to go ahead and have you sent us the receipt For the new rental that was made okay, and that way we can go ahead and have this Well, here's a question of why why that doesn't seem necessary. Let me know let me just offer you see okay So what my wife's wanted to do is just take an uber and say we don't need a rental car So what if we had just said we'll take an uber and we're not gonna get a rental car at all You wouldn't either you wouldn't either receive for that in that case right yes, we would Bank statement Bank statement Yes, we're reflect the charge for the uber Okay, okay, all right fair enough so that you ask for my question. Thank you. Thank you for that Yes, you would happen okay. Yes. You would happen Martin if that sorry about that go ahead No, I don't tell me what happens See So what happens is that you have to you know, we are a third party of company, right? So we go through suppliers so in order for us to request something from the suppliers They will always trust me. They will always ask for backup Just you know first to give them backup for them to you know be able to work with ever request We are asking for that's why I'm asking you for a receipt So that in the longer run if I submit the request afterwards, you know, they're not gonna ask me for that again You know, and I will be to give them that because you know I don't have it so that's why I'm asking you to send it over You know as soon as possible that way the better the quicker we get it the better because we can start working on this Yep, and really to pass all the able to get the smoothie. So we're both we agree on it So here's the question which part of the agreements you need is multiple pages The one where you just made the reservation basically and how much you paid Okay, just fair enough. Okay, good Okay, great Thank you block. I appreciate your help very much. No problem about that Martin the request will be submitted Okay at the moment. I cannot go ahead and guarantee you anything because you know, we still have to go through the supplier But the request is there so I mean we definitely will go ahead and work on it and as soon as we get an update You will be notified. Okay, Martin. Yeah, so here's a We've gone through this and we're good. We all agree on this stuff You guys need to work on your on the on your portal because we're not like I said If I was in front of the customer agency and other people online And I couldn't get through to you at all because I followed your path through the number of you know Three and what it says if you want it if you want to talk to somebody by the reservation press Well when I press to it hung up on me. So what time was it? No, it wasn't just once it happened to me twice it happened to her once So you see what time do you know time? Yeah, I can tell you what's true. Did it happen in 9 15 and happening in 930 you have to record the time sorry. What time was that? Well, you need the exact time it happened it has it happened every time I did it So we were sure online you first got there around 4 to 10 40 not the 945 Pacific time and then And I thought for the time and you know it happened to her she happened to her first and they happened twice So I mean I can't give you that time obviously But that was around those times if I did it right now, I can guarantee you the same thing was happening. I'll report it So I'm asking because it could have possibly been when our office was still closed But I mean if it was during that time it was like what you've been our time and we're all we are available from 9 a.m. Eastern Standard Time Yeah, so that was a This is in the time that you were open in that case and so you're each time there's no question when you ask so That wouldn't that wouldn't have been the issue but exactly Exactly as we open at 9 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. So I mean if you called 10 Pacific Yeah, we would definitely should have answered. I'm not sure what happened there. Yeah, and again, I'm I'm doing I'm I'm giving you this as a customer service group because I'm not just a customer I'm a consultant and I'm expecting to give other people the go-ahead to use your service And I would hate for that anybody that I'd like to have to go to what I want you today Yeah, I couldn't right. Yeah, I understand there are more tonight and I apologize, you know Whoa You
