duplicate.bash was used to make 1002 copies of 3 .wav files of size 1,3,5 MB

ls test_set | wc -l
# 1002
we have 1002 .wav files in a folder named test_set in this folder

experiments if ffmpeg conversion is faster using multiple threads or processes.

cmd: ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le output.wav

# experiment_1.py
#### 1002 .wav files conversion using a single process subprocess.run took 43.41 seconds

# experiment_2.py
#### 1002 .wav files conversion using multiple threads took 7.51 seconds (concurrent.futures ThreadPoolExecutor)


### when i run experiment_2.py for 50,000 .wav files it took 6 minutes
